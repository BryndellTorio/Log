next rev ---

~ put back the Hall effect sensor for detection of the manual lever
~ T[1:3] input on micro might change to U6 output schmitt
~ remove the swf connector and other components once the tunning is achieve
~ dnp c43
~ dnp R128

~ populate R89

~ disconnect pin-5 from the shorted pin 5-2-3 of IC1 
 *disconnect IC1-pin5 to +ECLK
~ LED2 part BL-BUBGE204 is a common anode from testing. datasheet indicated its a common cathode.
~ dnp D33/D32/D34
